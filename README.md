# Task

This is a test to see how you approach a problem and how you write code. We
are not looking for a perfect solution, not at all.

We are looking for an attempt that shows us that you can write code that is clean, readable, and
maintainable.

1. Develop a React Native mobile application that reaches out to this GraphQL
   endpoint <https://studio.apollographql.com/public/countries/home?variant=current>
2. Display a list of countries with their name, and flag
3. Allow the user to search for a country by name
4. Allow the user to click on a country to see more details about it
5. Store the list in a state management library of your choice
6. Implement caching
7. Use Typescript
8. Go crazy, write tests, write **performant** code, write clean code, write code that you would be proud to show off to your friends and family.
